# Privacy Policy

Ackee is a privacy first product that keeps tracked data anonymized. It's therefore not required to mention Ackee in your privacy policy. Ackee doesn't store IP addresses or other personal identifiable information by default. It doesn't even use cookies, therefore, it doesn't need to be added to your cookie banner either.

Although, we recommend to mention Ackee in your privacy policy. Let your visitors know that you're using a privacy friendly analytics tool which doesn't collect personal identifiable information.

> ⚠️ Make sure to ask your users before activating the `detailed` mode of Ackee. The detailed mode tracks more data and also includes data [we're considering as personal data](Anonymization.md#personal-data). In this case it's highly recommended to add Ackee to your privacy policy.

analytics software gives us insight about our visitors only in general, but not
about individuals per se, as it does not track visitors and does not store any
personal identifiable information.
